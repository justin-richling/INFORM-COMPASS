# Running SCAM

## Introduction
SCAM, the [Single Column Atmosphere Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/simple/scam) is a single column model version of the [Community Atmospheric Model (CAM)](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cam), a global atmosphere model developed at NSF NCAR for the weather and climate research communities.

This page describes the basic setup for running SCAM. Once you have this configured you can [Create Nudged IOP forcing using CAM for use with SCAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/scam_nudge/) or [run scamTEST]({{ site.baseurl }}/scam_test/) to ensure your setup is correct.

## Login to Derecho
SCAM can be run from the Derecho supercomputer at NCAR. If you haven't already, [login to derecho and clone the repo]({{ site.baseurl }}/derecho/)

## Identify available projects/accounts
Running SCAM on the Derecho supercomputer requires access to CPU core-hours.  You can find out which projects/accounts are linked to your login via the Systems Accounting Manager webpage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://sam.ucar.edu](https://sam.ucar.edu)

or from the command line while logged into Derecho by providing a bogus project to the qinteractive command
```tcsh
> qinteractive -A P99999999 @derecho
```
The command will return a list of available accounts:
```tcsh
qsub: Invalid account for CPU usage, available accounts:
Project, Status, Active
Pxxxxxxxx, Normal, True
Pxxxxxxxx, Normal, True
,etc
```
* where xxxxxxxx is the actual project where you have access. If there are no projects available you will need to reach out to whomever in your group/program provides core-hours and request an allocation. Note which projects are available to you.

## Create a scratch directory
You will need to configure a scratch directory where SCAM can write files. Each Derecho user should have a /glade/derecho/scratch directory. Create a scam dir under your scratch dir.
```tcsh
> ls /glade/derecho/scratch/<YOUR_USERNAME>
> mkdir /glade/derecho/scratch/<YOUR_USERNAME>/scam
```

# Useful scam commands
## To check the status of the run:
```tcsh
more CaseStatus
-or-
qstat -u <YOUR_USERNAME>
```
[qstat documentation](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbs/?h=qstat#qstat)

## To delete a run
```tcsh
qdel #######
```
where ###### is the Job ID from qstat
